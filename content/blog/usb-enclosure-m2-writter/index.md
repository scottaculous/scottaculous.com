I seem to be constantly shorting my SATA SSD hard drives.  There is a graveyard of hard drives.  The cheapest SSDs one can buy. 

Apparently you must be selective about which SATA cable your power supply uses.  It turns out they are not the same.  They are supposed to be.  For the record, shorted SSDs smells like burnt plastic.

My solution to this problem?  Don't buy SATA hard drives.  Buy M.2 SSDs.  Ta-da!  In order to reimage them, I bought [Sabrent USB 3.2 Type-C Tool-Free Enclosure for M.2 PCIe NVMe and SATA SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B08RVC6F9Y/).
